**Argo documentation**

The Argo data format is fully described in the [Argo User Manual](http://dx.doi.org/10.13155/29825): This format is the input format  for the Q.C.V. Harmonizer and the output format for the Biogeochemical calibration tool when direct access to Argo data is used for reporting DMQC action.

The Argo procedures for quality controls of biogeochemical variables are described in the [documentation webpage](http://www.argodatamgt.org/Documentation). In particular, the Nitrate workflow follows instructions from :
- the [BGC-Argo quality control manual for nitrate concentration](https://doi.org/10.13155/84370)
- the recommendation from Euro-Argo RISE project [D4.5: Recommendations for enhancement of NO3 QC Methods](https://zenodo.org/records/7369098)‚Å†.
