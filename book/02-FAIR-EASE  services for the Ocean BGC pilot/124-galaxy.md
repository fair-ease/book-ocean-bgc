[Galaxy Earth System Sciences](https://earth-system.usegalaxy.eu/) is an open source web platform born from [Galaxy Europe](https://galaxyproject.org/) for sharing and processing research data useful for the Fair-Ease project.

In this context, all the containerized components of the easy Q.C.V BGC were added within the Galaxy Earth System Science instance with the support of Marie Jossé{sup}`[![alt text](../../embedded-ressources/logo/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0009-0008-0622-604X)` and Jérôme Detoc{sup}`[![alt text](../../embedded-ressources/logo/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-1320-8349)`.

An `easy Q.C.V BGC Nitrate workflow` has been set-up and is accessible on Galaxy for running it ([Argo-Glider Nitrate QCV](https://earth-system.usegalaxy.eu/published/workflow?id=44827462c065bae3) workflow) as well as a [Galaxy tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/climate/tutorials/ocean_qcv_analysis/tutorial.html) for helping novices for DM operations and/or Galaxy usage. 
Working hand in hand with the Galaxy team enabled us to implement a versatile tool for inputs, outputs, and parameterization.
