Testbed (https://eoscfe.mesocentre.uca.fr/) provides Earth Science researchers with an environment where to test easy-to-use and technology agnostic solutions, allowing interoperable data storage and data management. The testbed infrastructure is a component of FAIR-EASE project Data Lake. This data lake is globally to be seen as an object store, providing heterogeneous data access and management and analytic services from various sources and various infrastructures with a combination of agile technologies, tools and services either already in use or with the potential for being used by user communities. The Testbed infrastructure provides S3 object storage at production level and virtualization resources for deploying tools relevant to Earth Science researchers. It has allowed integrating a series of cloud optimised services (webODV, beacon, examind, terriaMap, EGI checkin, Galaxy Pulsar, IDDAS, UDAL â€¦)
