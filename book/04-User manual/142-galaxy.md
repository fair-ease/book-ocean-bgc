# How to run the easy QCV from Galaxy workflows

This tutorial explains how to qualify and calibrate the nitrate sensor mounted on the argo float 4903881 tool by tool or running a pre-design galaxy workflow. This tutorial is accompanied by screenshots to guide you. If you have any difficulties, or suggestions for improvement, please contact us (link to the contact page). For your information, execution time for running tools depends on the number of files, their size and/or the number of people working on Galaxy.
WARNING : DO NOT change file names to ensure that any changes you make with ODV will be carried over. However, it is possible to change the name of galaxy collections to make them easier to find.
